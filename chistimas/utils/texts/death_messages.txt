x has never had a snowball fight before, and got yeeted off by a snowball before the game started.
x was too busy admiring their crush from far away & they got hit by a snowball at 1500kmph.
x left the game due to sneezing too much!
x is too kind-hearted for fights.
x went to befriend the Penguins in the nearby lake!
x went to go meet Santa, but got lost in the North pole!
x opened the door, but the snow kicked x out!
x slipped on their own snowball and landed on their butt. Well.. that didn't end well for x .
x went to the snow shop, but forgot their wallet in the house.
x decides to build an igloo and is far too distracted to continue the snowball fight.
